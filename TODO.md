A list of things still to be done. Pick them off the list, one by one, and move them to a DONE state once you are finished. 

For example

- [ ] This is not done. No X in the box.
- [X] This is DONE. 

Formed ideas (you can do these)

- [X] Make sure the app works well in dark mode
- [X] Change the "rucord" title to be the SF Symbol icon used in the empty page
- [X] Change the accent colour to be #4ab1ff
- [X] Remove the car image in the main Cell, and change the cells to not have rounded corners
- [X] In the Update Odometer, select the first entry box when the screen loads (bring the keyboard up)
- [X] Same for add a car
- [X] Change "Quick bump" to be "Quick add", and set the paramters to be 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000
- [X] Keep a backup of the JSON file when writing it it, and if the main one can't be loaded, go back to the previous version
- [X] Allow the user to either pick a picture for their car, or take/pick a photo and use that as the header for the cell in the main list. If the user takes a picuture or picks one from their album, store it in the local file space for the app
- [X] Also show the car image (picked or taken) in the car detail.
- [X] The image picker works well in the "edit car" screen, but when adding it doesn't. Can you make the add car one work the same as the edit car one
- [X] Make the app show a red dot alert on the icon, and show a push notification, when the cars RUC has 14 days left to run. Opening the app should remove the red dot
- [X] Allow a car to be deleted - with a warning! - from the edit screen
- [X] Put a reminder in for 7 days for the first 3 readings then every 30 days after that, to add another reading
- [X] Like the RUC, I want to prompt the user for when their WOF (warrent of fitness) and Registration will expire, and if set, remind them with a push notification 6 weeks before it expires

Unformed ideas (don't do these unless asked)
- [ ] Move to using CloudKit for the data storage
