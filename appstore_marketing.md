## Long description
Rucord helps New Zealand drivers stay on top of Road User Charges (RUC). Track odometer readings for your vehicles, see exactly how many kilometres remain on your current RUC block, and get timely reminders before you run out.

### Key features
- Track multiple vehicles
- Clear "kilometres remaining" until your current RUC block expires
- Smart projections: estimated days remaining based on your recent driving
- Timely alerts:
  - 14‑day "RUC due soon" push notification with app badge
  - Odometer reading reminders: 7 days after each of your first three readings, then every 30 days thereafter
- Quick Add: instantly add +1,000 / +2,000 / +5,000 / +10,000 km
- Photos: pick or take a photo to personalise each vehicle
- Fast entry: forms focus the first field automatically to bring up the keyboard
- Dark Mode support with a clean, modern SwiftUI design

### How it works
- Add your vehicle and current RUC expiry odometer
- Enter odometer readings as you drive (or use Quick Add for convenience)
- Rucord shows your remaining kilometres and projects when you’ll reach your RUC limit
- You’ll receive reminders to add readings and a heads‑up 14 days before your RUC is due

### Privacy-first by design
- Your data stays on your device (local storage with automatic backup for safety)
- No accounts to create. No tracking. Works fully offline

Stay compliant, avoid surprises, and make RUC simple with Rucord.
